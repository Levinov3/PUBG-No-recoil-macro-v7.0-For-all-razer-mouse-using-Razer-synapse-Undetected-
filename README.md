Make sure this is selected, my in-game sensitivity is set to default

instructions for Razer Synapse 3 only:
1. Download the .xml macro file.
2. Open Razer Synapse.
3. If you don't have macro downloaded in modules, do that.
4. Macros tab may not appear so on the top of the screen, press the modules section and download the Macros module.
5. On the "My Macros" tab, press the down-arrow within a square symbol. Click on my macro .xml file
6. Once imported, click on the "Mafia4321x-vXX" and on the right hand side, click the "+" next to Key Binds.
7. Press your mouse, then assign the macro to any mouse button. I personally use Mouse button 4, but if left click works for you, you can assign it to that. When you find the button, select "play while assigned" under Playback Option.
8. Save the setting.
9. Load up PUBG, and go into a training match to tune the in-game sensitivity. My DPI is 1300, having a slower DPI probably helps but I don't recommend it.
10. Adjust in-game sensitivity, to the picture above
P.S. This does not remove all recoil, it just makes the weapon easier to control. This primarily works for ARs, so no auto VSS or machine guns. This is best to be a supplement and don't rely exclusively on the macro otherwise you won't improve in the game.
